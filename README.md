<h2> clock ~ a simple event listener program</h2>

<p> This project is for personal use and is not intended for use in other projects, thus I will be treating this readme more as a journal entry than documentation. </p>

<h4> Why? </h4>

This tool is the second entry in my journey to implement small QOL changes in my daily life through code. In my day job I work as a software consultant. I don't write any code, however, I still enjoy developing the odd side project and learning new things. The premise of this app is quite simple, I type out my own email quite a lot (E.g. logging in, setting up access, etc) and it is quite an annoyingly long one. So I decided to develop a program to:

<ul>
  <li>Listen for a specific key bind (Ctrl + Alt + A)</li>
  <li>Set the current clipboard item to my email</li>
  <li>Invoke a print method</li>
</ul>
